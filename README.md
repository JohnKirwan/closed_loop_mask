# closed_loop_mask

We used the files in this repo to record an animal (a chiton) and quickly
project modified images of the animal over itself.

The file names should be generalized for any photic behaviour experiment. Thus,
startle_chiton.m can become project_mask.m and all occurences of startle_chiton
can become project_mask. Similarly, chiton_blackout, valve_blackout and girdle_blackout can become whole_mask, interior_mask and periphery_mask throughout, respectively.
